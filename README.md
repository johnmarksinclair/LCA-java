# LCA-java
LCA java implementation for Software Engineering 

Part 1: To implement a function that can calculate the lowest common ancestor in a graph, that may be structured as a binary tree.

Part 2: Enhance your previous LCA solution, implementing as a branch that you must ultimately merge with your master branch, an implementation of LCA that can work for graphs structured in directed acyclic form.
